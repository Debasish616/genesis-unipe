# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipfile.lock must be ignored to avoid any issues.
# Pipfile.lock

# Poetry
#   If you are using poetry for packaging and dependency management, you can safely ignore the
#   `poetry.lock` file, it will be regenerated after each `poetry install` command.
# poetry.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow and github.com/pdm-project/pdm
